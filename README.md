# Yii2 DataLayer helper

This extension is managed to help you fulfill dataLayer variable with initial data on fly.
Some Google enhanced e-commerce features are also available.

## Installation
* The minimum required PHP version is PHP 7.1,
* [Yii2](https://www.yiiframework.com/) is required.
### Using composer
Add following line in your required section:
```
"dekar91/yii2-datalayer": "@stable"

```
Then, register the component in your application config:
```
        'dataLayer' => [
            'class' => 'dekar91\datalayer\DataLayer'
        ],
```


## Configuration
Plugin involves both PHP and JavaScript functionality. PHP component supports following parameters:

| Parameter  | Default | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| autoPublish  | true | Whether catch EVENT_END_PAGE event in order to render DataLayer. If false you should render datalayer by yourself though getJs or render method  |
| observers  | ['ec' => ['class' => DataLayerEc::class]] |Array of classes may be used like wrapper on datalayer accessible by key each element must be following format: 'key' => ['class' => {name of class to be loaded}, 'options' => {Additional options}.   |
| customEvents  | [] | Array of event must be handled by JavaScript.Format: ['jsSelector' => 'nameOfEvent', 'customEventData'] |

Configuration example:
```
        'dataLayer' => [
            'class' => 'dekar91\datalayer\DataLayer',
            'options' => [
                'autoPublish' => true,
                'observers' => ['ec' => ['class' => DataLayerEc::class]],
                'customEvents' => [
                    ['.btn-checkout', 'click' , ['event' => 'checkoutEvent']],
                    ]
                ]
        ],
```

with this configuration you DataLayer will be published, DataLayerEc can be used by Yii::app()-> dalaLayer->ec,
click on .btn-checkout will be handled and event information will be pushed in dataLayer.
